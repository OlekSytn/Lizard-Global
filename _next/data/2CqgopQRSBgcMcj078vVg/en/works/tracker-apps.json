They follow this passion by providing feedback to students and teachers to develop their skills and the implementation of the curriculum of the International Baccalaureate (IB) programmes.","challenge":"The IB Diploma Programme (DP) requires schools to properly record, track, and report the skills students are acquiring. This raises a need for one centralized place or platform on which students can manage their schoolwork and track their skills and where teachers can get insights into the learning experience of their students.","solution":"Together with Tracker Apps, Lizard Global developed two applications: Skill Tracker and Service Tracker. These two platforms encourage students to individually track ATL (Approaches to Teaching and Learning) skill development and record their learning progress, activities, reflections, and experiences. Using these two applications, teachers can easily track the progress of their students and manage their curriculum to improve the overall learning experience.","link_website":"https://tracker-apps.com/","link_apple":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tracker-apps/id1390479942","link_google":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skilltracker&hl=en","involvement_points":"Digital Conceptualization, Agile Software Development, UI/UX Design","involvement_text":"Skill Tracker and Service Tracker provide a digital space for students to track their ATL skill development and to record their learning experience and reflection through gamified features.

Not only do the applications stimulate students to improve their skills, it also forms a new stepping stone towards worldwide access to education.","client_name":"TRACKER APPS","description":"Tracker
